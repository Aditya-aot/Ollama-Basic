# Ollama-Basic

Ollama allows you to run open-source large language models, such as Llama 2, locally.

Ollama bundles model weights, configuration, and data into a single package, defined by a Modelfile.

It optimizes setup and configuration details, including GPU usage.

For a complete list of supported models and model variants, see the Ollama model library.
